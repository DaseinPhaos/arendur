# arendur

[travis](https://travis-ci.org/DaseinPhaos/arendur.svg?branch=master)

Just Another Renderer. This time in Rust though.

This is a project guided by [pbrt](http://www.pbrt.org/). Its on `0.0.1` for the time being, meaning it can't render anything just yet.

To tinker with it you can either clone the source code with `git`:

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/DaseinPhaos/arendur.git
   $ cd arendur
   ```

or simply grab it from [crates.io](https:://crates.io).
