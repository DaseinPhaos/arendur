# arendur

[travis](https://travis-ci.org/DaseinPhaos/arendur.svg?branch=master)

Just Another Renderer. This time in Rust though.

This is a project guided by [pbrt](http://www.pbrt.org/). Its on `0.0.2` for the time being, with only a partially implemented whitted ray tracer.

To tinker with it you can either clone the source code with `git`:

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/DaseinPhaos/arendur.git
   $ cd arendur
   ```

or simply grab it from [crates.io](https:://crates.io).

## What's next

Before 0.1, I want the module to support:

- a console interface
- area lights
- more materials
- a bidirectional path tracing based renderer
