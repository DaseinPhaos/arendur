# arendur

Just Another Renderer. This time in rust though.

This is a project for personal study, guided by [pbrt](http://www.pbrt.org/). The implementation does have some Rusty-strength though, feel free to check out!

To tinker with it you can either clone the source code with `git`:

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/DaseinPhaos/arendur.git
   $ cd arendur
   ```

or simply grab it from [crates.io](https:://crates.io).
